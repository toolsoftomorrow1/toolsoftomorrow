# Tools of Tomorrow

Algorithmic Market Tools & Automation

We design and develop **custom algorithmic systems**, research tools,
and automation infrastructure for financial markets.

Our work focuses on **logic engineering, execution flow, and system reliability** —
not on selling trading results.

---

## Focus Areas

- TradingView indicator & strategy logic development  
- MT5 Expert Advisor development (rule-based automation)  
- API-based execution systems (TradingView → Backend → Broker)  
- Risk-aware system architecture  
- Strategy testing, validation, and optimization frameworks  
- Licensing, access control, and deployment workflows  

---

## System Demonstrations

Below are **internal system demonstrations** built to showcase  
execution flow, automation quality, and logic structuring.

> These are **NOT live client systems**  
> and **do NOT represent performance or profit guarantees**.

---

### 1. TradingView → API Execution System (Demo)

Demonstrates:
- TradingView signal generation  
- Backend validation & rule checks  
- Broker API execution flow  
- Order logging & safety controls  

*(Screenshot / architecture diagram placeholder)*

---

### 2. MT5 Rule-Based Expert Advisor (Demo Environment)

Demonstrates:
- Structured entry & exit rules  
- Risk management handling  
- Demo-only execution logic  
- Safety filters & trade controls

---

### 3. TradingView Custom Indicator (Logic Demo)

Demonstrates:
- Custom condition filtering  
- Trend & strength validation  
- Visual trade-state labeling (BUY / EXIT)

## Important Notice

Tools of Tomorrow **does NOT provide**:
- Trading services  
- Buy/Sell signals  
- Fund management  
- Financial or investment advice  

All projects are created for:
- System development  
- Logic validation  
- Automation testing  
- Research & educational purposes  

Final implementations are built **privately per client**
based on their specific requirements.

---

## Sample Project Frameworks

- EMA-based Trend Logic Systems  
- Rule-based Scalping & Intraday Structures  
- Risk-controlled algorithmic modules  
- Strategy-to-execution automation pipelines  

*(Project names are representative of logic structure, not live products.)*

---

## GitHub Pages Usage

This repository is used to demonstrate **system architecture and execution flow only**.

Live deployments, proprietary logic, and client-specific systems  
are **never shared publicly**.
