# System Demonstrations

This section contains **internal system demonstrations** created to explain  
how algorithmic trading systems are designed, structured, and executed.

The focus is on:

- Rule validation
- Risk handling

> and do NOT represent trading performance or profitability.

They are shared strictly for:
